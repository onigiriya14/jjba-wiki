    <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Ripple"><h3>Jonathan Joestar</h3></a>
    <p>Jonathan Joestar is the protagonist of Phantom Blood and the first JoJo of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series. 
	He is characterized as being kind, honest, and loyal, as a direct counterpart to his adopted brother, the evil Dio.</p>
	
	<p>A skilled Ripple user such as Jonathan has the ability to walk on water,
	strengthen objects and increase their potency, increase jumping height, and much more. 
	The Ripple can heal fractured bones as well as lessen one's sense of pain.</p>

    <img src="images/joseph.jpg" alt="Character 2">
    <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Ripple"> <h3>Joseph Joestar</h3></a>
    <p>Joseph is 18 years old, tall (195 cm/6'5"), and powerfully built, with light eyes. 
	He has short, dark, and unkempt hair, parts of his bangs shooting outwards in spikes, 
	apart from which he closely resembles his grandfather Jonathan Joestar</p>
	
	<p>Joseph Joestar inherited a natural capacity for the energy-based Hamon martial arts technique. 
	While unskilled with it until he began training under his mother, 
	he uses its conductive properties on a pair of clackers and other objects in battle.</p>

  <div class="character">
    <img src="images/jotaro.jpg" alt="Character 3">
    <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Platinum"> <h3>Jotaro Joestar</h3></a>
    <p>Jotaro is introduced as a rough delinquent, but he has a gentle heart and is loyal to those he likes. 
	He is highly perceptive, intelligent, and quick-witted while keeping a perpetually cool, slightly neutral, 
	or disinterested attitude. 
	Jotaro's most noticeable trait is his seemingly aloof nature.</p>
	
	<p>He has a Stand (a physical manifestation of his fighting spirit) 
	named Star Platinum ( 星の白金 スタープラチナ , Sutā Purachina), 
	whose power is incredible strength, speed, and precision.</p>
	
	<p>Star Platinum is a close-range Stand with a range of two meters. 
	With his Stand, he is able to throw incredibly fast punches. 
	Star Platinum is known for its speed, which allows him to take hold 
	of bullets that get shot at him point blank.</p>

    <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Crazy_Diamond"><h3>Josuke Higashikata</h3></a>
    <p>Josuke is a tall, young man of average build. His most prominent feature 
	is his well-maintained pompadour with two small, 
	curved spikes in the back, styled after that of an unknown man who saved his life as a child. 
	His pompadour has a tendency to become spiky with his mood, such as when he is irritated or angry.</p>
    
	<p>Josuke can easily exploit the environment to his advantage thanks to Crazy Diamond.
	His ability to repair makes it so he can manipulate the environment to a certain point,
	creating a shield out of concrete,
	and lay down a trap with an object's broken pieces only to repair it around an enemy.</p>

    <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Experience"><h3>Giorno Giovanna</h3></a>
    <p>Giorno is a teenage boy of average height, a slim yet muscular build,
	and is far smaller in stature than previous JoJos.
	He has golden hair of moderate length tied back in a short, 
	braided tail, with three distinctive oversized curls arranged in a row over his forehead.</p>
	
	<p>Giorno's stand, Golden Experience, has the ability to reshape matter into a living creature.
	The majority of the time he would transform items into plants or small animals. 
	He would do this to track, hide items, and occasionally heal one of his teammates.</p>

    <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Stone_Free"><h3>Jolyn Cujoh</h3></a>
    <p>Jolyne Cujoh is an inmate at Green Dolphin Street Prison, 
	and is the daughter of the Stardust Crusaders main protagonist Jotaro Kujo. 
	Her Stand is Stone Free, which allows her to unravel her body into multiple threads. 
	Jotaro Kujo returns from Stardust Crusaders and Diamond is Unbreakable as Jolyne's father.</p>
	
	<p>Like her father's Star Platinum, Jolyne's Stone Free is both powerful and fast, 
	making it great for fighting physically. Moreover, 
	its string power allows her to unravel her body into string,
	typically beginning with her hands, and freely manipulate it.</p>
